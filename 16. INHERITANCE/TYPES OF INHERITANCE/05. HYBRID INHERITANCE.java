// Combination of more than one type of inheritance.
// Note: Java doesn‚Äôt support hybrid inheritance with classes, but we can use interfaces.

// üîµ HYBRID INHERITANCE: IT IS A MIX OF TWO OR MORE OF THE ABOVE TYPES OF INHERITANCE. SINCE JAVA DOESN'T SUPPORT MULTIPLE INHERITANCE WITH CLASSES, HYBRID INHERITANCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE WITH CLASSES.
// ‚ú≥Ô∏è IN JAVA, WE CAN ACHIEVE HYBRID INHERITANCE ONLY THROUGH INTERFACES, IF WE WANT TO INVOLVE MULTIPLE INHERITANCE TO IMPLEMENT HYBRID INHERITANCE.
// üìå NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HYBRID INHERITANCE DOES NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE USE OF MULTIPLE INHERITANCE EXCLUSIVELY.
// ‚ú≥Ô∏è IT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE AND HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE WITH CLASSES, HIERARCHICAL AND SINGLE INHERITANCE WITH CLASSES.
// ‚ú≥Ô∏è IT IS INDEED POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT HYBRID INHERITANCE USING CLASSES ALONE, WITHOUT RELYING ON MULTIPLE INHERITANCE TYPE.
